#Catstagram
Looking to try out some of the new features in Xcode Server, well then this is the project for you!

##Setup
This project requires 3 things to get you up and running quickly.

1. An Instagram API Key - [Sign up and register a client here](http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/). Add this key to `Catstagrame/key.txt`.
2. A **fork**! Since the provisioning profile UID is now added to the project file, in order for Xcode Server to build this correctly, you need to commit that change to the source.
3. CocoaPods. The `Pods` folder is not checked in, so make sure to `pod install` before opening.

That's it! Enjoy the Cats of Instagram.


##TODO:
